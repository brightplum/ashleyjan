I address the Black maternal mortality and morbidity crisis in America through painting and multimedia. Black women are still three to four times more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications than white women. Influenced by my own traumatic pregnancy and survival, the imagery centers the experiences of Black mothers, birthing people, and children who have suffered adverse birth outcomes but challenge the institutional modes in finding solutions. Familial vantage points shift resolution perceptions after experienced birth trauma. Dynamics foster movements in time through figuration and space. Confronting themes through quiet, often heavy motifs, the environments articulate the imposed health effects disproportionately experienced. Continuing the often layered and nuanced conversation surrounding Black maternal health, the images serve as a global call to action for more awareness, research, and the eradication of unnecessary maternal and infant death.

My first pregnancy abruptly ended with a traumatic delivery. I was diagnosed with preeclampsia
at 32 weeks and 4 days. Two days later, I delivered by emergency c-section. My baby boy was
born prematurely with a low birth weight of 2 pounds and 13 ounces. Mothers who have suffered
similar complications that lead to more adverse birth outcomes are considered to be a “near miss”
meaning that they suffered severe maternal morbidity (SMM) in which Black women are
disproportionately affected.

While uplifting Black mothers and children, the images and sound narratives serve as a call to
action for more awareness, research, and eradication of unnecessary maternal and infant death in
the United States of America.
