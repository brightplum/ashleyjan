I address the Black maternal mortality and morbidity crisis in America through painting and
multimedia. Influenced by my own traumatic pregnancy and survival, the imagery centers on the
experiences of Black mothers, birthing people, and children who have suffered adverse birth
outcomes but challenge the institutional modes in finding solutions. Confronting themes through
quiet, often heavy motifs, the artistic environments articulate the imposed health effects
disproportionately experienced. All familial perspectives are considered after a tangential birth
trauma survival. Continuing the delicately layered conversation surrounding Black maternal
health, the images serve as a global call to action for more awareness, research, and the
eradication of unnecessary maternal and infant deaths.
