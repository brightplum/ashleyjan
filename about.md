I address the Black maternal mortality and morbidity crisis in America through painting and multimedia. Black women are still three to four times more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications than white women. Influenced by my own traumatic pregnancy and survival, the imagery centers the experiences of Black mothers, birthing people, and children who have suffered adverse birth outcomes but challenge the institutional modes in finding solutions. Familial vantage points shift resolution perceptions after experienced birth trauma. Dynamics foster movements in time through figuration and space. Confronting themes through quiet, often heavy motifs, the environments articulate the imposed health effects disproportionately experienced. Continuing the often layered and nuanced conversation surrounding Black maternal health, the images serve as a global call to action for more awareness, research, and the eradication of unnecessary maternal and infant death.
